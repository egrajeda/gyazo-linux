This is the unofficial (at least for now) version for Linux of the Gyazo 
application. Gyazo is an open-source image hosting service (http://gyazo.com).

This application lets you select an area of the screen and then it 
automatically uploads it to Gyazo, opens it in a web browser and copy the URL
to the clipboard.

I used a lot of code from gnome-screenshot, so thanks a lot to the people that 
contributed to it, namely Jonathan Blandfordh and Cosimo Cecchi according to 
the source code header.
